# RCBi_centernet
- The top 19 solution of Kaggle competition "Peking University/Baidu - Autonomous Driving";
- The source code of paper "RCBi-CenterNet: An Absolute Pose Policy for 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving"

The code could be run directly.

# Description of Competition
Baidu's Robotics and Autonomous Driving Lab (RAL), along with Peking University, hopes to close the gap once and for all with this challenge. Theyâ€™re providing Kagglers with more than 60,000 labeled 3D car instances from 5,277 real-world images, based on industry-grade CAD car models.

Your challenge: develop an algorithm to estimate the absolute pose of vehicles (6 degrees of freedom) from a single image in a real-world traffic environment.

Succeed and you'll help improve computer vision. That, in turn, will bring autonomous vehicles a big step closer to widespread adoption, so they can help reduce the environmental impact of our growing societies.
